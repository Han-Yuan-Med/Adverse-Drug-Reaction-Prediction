# Adverse Drug Reaction Predition

Early prediction of Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) is crucial in clinical scenarios. The development and widely adopted electronic medical records (EMRs) provide an excellent dataset for retrospective studies to train models for future early detection. However, traditional statistical measures like multivariate logistic regression (LR) cannot handle the difficulties of high dimensional data and unbalanced data. In this research, we first transformed the EMRs including Chinese medical notes into numeric variables. Then we introduced support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), AdaBoost, XGBoost, and artificial neural network (ANN) to solve the challenge of high dimension and utilized a simple but powerful tool ensembling to tackle the difficulty of unbalance. Finally, we analyzed potential mechanisms to provide model interpretability and compare different methods from the perspective of elapsed time. The experimental result shows considerable improvement in prediction ability through the implementation of ensembling on advanced machine learning methods. Compared with the baseline model LR, three machine learning methods RF, AdaBoost, XGBoost present superiority, and ANN without fine-tuning show similar competence. Besides, we presented interpretable machine learning models that could be used for providing further investigation directions in the medical domain.
